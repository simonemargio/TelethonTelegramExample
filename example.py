   Server waits for a message from the client. When someone writes you on Telegram 
   a comparison is made on what has been written and what has been written as the first argument.

   The pattern argument can be constructed using regular expressions, like this
   you have the maximum management of the strings. To know more (https://duckduckgo.com/?q=regular+expression+python&t=h_&ia=web or https://duckduckgo.com/?q=regular+expression+%22telethon%22&t=h_&ia=web)
   Ad esempio: (?i) means that starts case-insensitive mode.
                ^ e $ identify the beginning and the end of the string on which to perform the analysis.
   In this example anyone who writes help, regardless of the characters (help, HElP, hElP etc.) will receive the automatic reply
   described in event.reply. ^ and $ they allow only those who write help to reply and that's it as a message:
      - help (ok)
      - Hello, help (no)
      - hELP (ok)
      - Yo help (no)

   time.sleep(n) is the time in n seconds to wait before the automatic reply is sent. It can also be omitted but
   adding a waiting time between replies creates a better conversational effect replied to an immediate reply.

   event.reply is the actual response message. Here, too, you can format the message (https://core.telegram.org/api/entities).
   For example **Hi** writes Hi in Bold format, \n allows new line etc.

   The second parameter of NewMessage allows you to evaluate the messages received only for private Telegram chats. If omitted then
   anyone writing "help" in any conversation (private chat, group, channels and more) will receive the scheduled automatic reply.
