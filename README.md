# Telethon Telegram
Telethon is an asyncio Python 3 MTProto library to interact with Telegram's API as a user or through a bot account (bot API alternative).  
[Here](https://docs.telethon.dev/en/stable/) is all the documentation on the project.

The present file is a simple example of how to set up an automatic reply based on the message you receive on Telegram. It can be a starting point for those who start using Telethon.
